The primary objective of this project is to develop a data-driven approach to predict the stock prices of Indian IT midcap companies using machine learning (ML) models. In the dynamic and volatile environment of the stock market, especially within the midcap sector of the Indian IT industry, accurate forecasting of stock price movements is crucial for investors, analysts, and financial institutions. This study seeks to investigate the extent to which various financial metrics—such as Open, High, Low, Volume Market Capitalization, Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, Face Value, Net Profit, and Earnings Per Share (EPS),Forward PE, Net Income ,Debt to Equity, Return on Equity (ROE), Current Ratio, Free Cash Flow, Operating Margin, Profit Margin, Quick Ratio, Price to Book Ratio, Enterprise Value, Total Debt—influence the share prices of these companies.

To achieve this, the project adopts a structured methodology beginning with exploratory data analysis and correlation techniques to identify the most relevant features affecting stock prices. The selected features are then used to train and test two different predictive models: Multiple Linear Regression, which helps in understanding the linear relationships between stock prices and financial indicators, and Random Forest Regressor, a robust ensemble learning method capable of capturing complex, non-linear interactions among variables.

The models are evaluated on the basis of prediction accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability. By comparing their performance, the study aims to determine the most effective technique for predicting stock prices in this specific sector. The findings are intended to contribute valuable insights into the financial analytics landscape, providing support for informed decision-making in areas such as portfolio management, stock screening, and market analysis.
Furthermore, this project explores how ML-driven predictive modeling can be integrated into fintech platforms to assist users in stock recommendation systems, thereby enhancing their functionality and relevance in real-world investment scenarios.

In essence, this research aspires to bridge the gap between historical financial performance and future stock price estimation using machine learning, paving the way for more accurate and efficient forecasting tools in the Indian midcap IT domain.Keywords : Machine Learning, Diabetes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Accuracy.
